# Tabulated Reinforcement Learning
## Windy Drone
This project features a custom-built Reinforcement Learning (RL) environment named `Windy Drone`, created **from scratch**. The environment is a 6×6 **gridworld** where a drone must navigate from a random starting point to a random destination while avoiding **obstacles** and managing its **battery** and **health**.

It includes implementations of several RL algorithms such as **Q-learning**, **SARSA**, **n-step Tree Backup**, and **Monte Carlo** which also developed **from scratch**. Each algorithm is thoroughly tested in this environment, with detailed pseudocode, implementation examples, and performance results provided. The environment’s reward system is influenced by **Gaussian distributions**, and episodes can be **truncated** based on battery and health levels.

## Frozen Lake
This project includes an implementation of **Q-learning** developed **from scratch**. It is thoroughly tested in the [Frozen Lake](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/) environment, and detailed pseudocode, implementation examples, and performance results are provided.
